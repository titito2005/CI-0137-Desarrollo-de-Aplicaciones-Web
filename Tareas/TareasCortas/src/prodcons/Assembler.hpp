/**
 * @brief An assembler is a worker of a assembly line. It receives incomplete
 * products, does some pre-defined work of them, and the resulting product
 * continues the assembly line, where other workers will add more parts. See
 * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_line for the term assembler.
 * 
 * An assembler is both, a consumer of incomplete products coming from a
 * consuming queue, and a producer that pushes results to a queue. The data type
 * of coming products may be different of the products that the Assembler
 * produces.
 * 
 * This class is abstract. You should inherit a class from Assembler and
 * override the consume() method, that is called each time a product is
 * consumed, then do some work with the product, and finally call produce()
 * to push the resulting product to the assembly line.
