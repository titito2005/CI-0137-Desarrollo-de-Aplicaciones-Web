/**
 * @brief Implements a TCP client
 * A client is a process that connects with a server process that is listening
 * at some known address and port. After establishing a TCP connection, both
 * can share information using a socket. Example of a minimal web client:
 * 
 * @code
    #include <iostream>
    #include <stdexcept>
    #include <string>

    #include "TcpClient.hpp"

    int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
      try {
        if (argc == 4) {
          TcpClient client;
          Socket& socket = client.connect(argv[1], argv[2]);
          socket << "GET " << argv[3] << " HTTP/1.0\r\n";
          socket << "Host: " << argv[1] << "\r\n\r\n";
          socket.send();

          std::string line;
          while (socket.readLine(line)) {
            std::cout << line << std::endl;
          }
        } else {
          std::cout << "usage: client SERVER PORT URI" << std::endl;
        }
      } catch (std::runtime_error& error) {
        std::cerr << error.what() << std::endl;
      }
    }
